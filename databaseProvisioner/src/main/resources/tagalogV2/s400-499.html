					1. O Lord of Life breathe upon me,<br/>
					Open Thy living spring to me,<br/>
					From my deepest part moving me,<br/>
					Light of Life is shining in me.<br/>

					2. O what a thought, Thou art in me,<br/>
					Neither in height nor depth to seek,<br/>
					Turn to my spirit, I'll see Thee,<br/>
					Spirit to spirit, Thou dost speak.<br/>
					<br/>
					3. Thou art now my Advocator, Lord,<br/>

					All Thou hast done in my behalf,<br/>
					All in my spirit touched by me.<br/>
					<br/>
					4. But ah, this faithless heart of mine,<br/>
					Often was moved, yet turned aside,<br/>
					Move, breathe, forgive me, Lord Divine,<br/>
					Let me function as Thou would guide.<br/>
					<br/>
					5. When my spirit's low and weak be,<br/>
					Unable to speak forth Thy grace,<br/>
					Oh breathe on me from deep within,<br/>
					That I be fully filled by Thee.<br/>

					Bukal ng buhay, Iyong buksan;<br/>
					Sa loob ko'y pakilusin,<br/>

					2. O, Ika'y sa loob namin,<br/>
					Di na kailangang hanapin;<br/>
					Sa espiritu'y bumaling,<br/>
					Magsalita Ka sa amin.<br/>
					<br/>
					3. Aking Tagapamagitan,<br/>
					Ako'y Iyong pinapahiran;<br/>
					Lahat sa 'ki'y ginawa Mo,<br/>
					Nahihipo sa 'spiritu.<br/>
					<br/>
					4. Di tapat ang aking puso,<br/>
					May pandama, di sumunod;<br/>
					Hipan ako at kumilos,<br/>
					Nang magpangsyon akong lubos.<br/>
					<br/>
					5. Kung espiritu'y mahina.<br/>
					Di masabi Iyong biyaya;<br/>
					Ang aking loob Iyong hipan,<br/>
					Nang ako'y Iyong mapuspusan.<br/>

					1. There's a life that's deeper than our mind,<br/>

					5. If there a longing be,<br/>
					Come Thou and "rob" my hopes;<br/>
					If I would yonder fly,<br/>
					Come Thou and rid my wings.<br/>
					<br/>
					Thou hast had the "quick" and "slow",<br/>
					All directions Thou lay hold;<br/>
					And submitting to Thy way,<br/>
					Humbly walking in Thy will.<br/>
					<br/>
					6. Give me boldness to face,<br/>
					The way Thou hast for me;<br/>
					Bring all my loves to naught,<br/>
					And bless with things I hate.<br/>
					<br/>
					Thou hast had the "quick" and "slow",<br/>
					All directions Thou lay hold;<br/>
					And submitting to Thy way,<br/>
					Humbly walking in Thy will.<br/>
					<br/>
					7. Oh, spare me not, my Lord,<br/>
					Nor stand Thou calmly still;<br/>
					All self-made choices void,<br/>
					Only Thy will to take.<br/>
					<br/>
					Thou hast had the "quick" and "slow",<br/>
					All directions Thou lay hold;<br/>
					And submitting to Thy way,<br/>
					Humbly walking in Thy will.<br/>

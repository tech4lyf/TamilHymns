					1. The apostle's teaching is the entire speaking of God in the New

					<br/>
					2 .The New Testament ministry is the unique ministry according to
					the apostles' teaching, the teaching of God's New Testament

					<br/>
					3. God's economy is His plan to dispense Himself into His chosen

					organic Body of Christ.<br/>
					<br/>
					4. The New Jerusalem as the consummation of God's eternal economy

					1. When we experience God as the blowing wind, the overshadowing
					cloud, the consuming fire, and the glowing electrum, we become
					the four living creatures, coordinating to carry out God's economy
					for His expression, move, and administration.<br/>
					<br/>
					2. The move of God to carry out His economy is by the high and
					awesome wheels with a clear sky, the throne, and a rainbow.<br/>
					<br/>
					3. Through the breathing of the Spirit, the Lord revives His dead
					and scattered people to form them into an army to deal with His
					enemy and to build them up as His dwelling place for His
					expression.<br/>
					<br/>
					4. If we would participate in the move of God in His recovery, we
					need to experience increasingly the flowing of the living water
					out of the house of God through the Lord's complete measuring
					and our absolute consecration.<br/>

					1. O, vanity, vanity, all things are vanity;<br/>
					Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ is our reality.<br/>
					Calling upon Him we've left Christianity,<br/>
					Building His Church in each locality.<br/>
					<br/>
					2. When we call O Lord Jesus, it really releases,<br/>
					We're filled and we're satisfied as Christ increases.<br/>
					The more that we call upon Jesus our Lord,<br/>
					The more we'll enjoy Him as life evermore.<br/>
					<br/>
					3. If you want to be freed from your dumbness and misery,<br/>
					Call on the Lord and He'll free you spontaneously;<br/>
					Don't wait forever, just open up to the flow,<br/>
					Then you will live and Christ in you will grow.<br/>
					<br/>
					1. Kahungkagan, O hungkag, lahat pawang hungkag!<br/>
					O Hesus! O Kristo! Siya lamang di hungkag;<br/>
					Iwanan ang Kristiyanidad, tawagin Siya,<br/>
					Itayo ang lokal na ekklesia.<br/>
					<br/>
					2. Nang tawagin "O Hesus!" 'spiritu'y lumaya,<br/>
					Napuno, nabusog, umapaw, natuwa!<br/>
					Lalong tatawagin: Panginoong Hesus,<br/>
					Buhay at pagtamasa ay lubos!<br/>
					<br/>
					3. Laya sa pagkapipi, 'di masabing dusa,<br/>
					Tawagin "O Hesus!" gapos mo'y mawala;<br/>
					Huwag mag-atubili sumama sa agos,<br/>
					Pangino'n sa iyo lalagong lubos.<br/>

					1. Do you know what you were made for?<br/>
					Do you ever wonder why?<br/>
					What's the purpose of your being?<br/>
					What's the reason you're alive?<br/>
					<br/>
					Do you know God wants to be your life,<br/>
					He wants to be your life,<br/>
					He wants to be your life,<br/>
					You were made with something deep within,<br/>
					Only to contain just Him.<br/>
					<br/>
					2. Deep within you have a spirit,<br/>
					Even deeper than your heart;<br/>
					Many other things can fill you,<br/>
					But only Jesus can fill this part.<br/>
					<br/>
					You have been so empty all these years,<br/>
					In spite of all you've tried,<br/>
					You're still not satisfied.<br/>
					Don't you feel a longing deep within,<br/>
					To open up and take Christ in?<br/>
					<br/>
					3. Doesn't matter how you see things,<br/>
					For in God's eyes, "all have sinned;"<br/>
					Jesus shed His blood to cleanse you,<br/>
					For the purpose of getting in.<br/>
					<br/>
					He's done everything there is to do,<br/>
					And He's the Spirit now<br/>
					So He can get in you.<br/>
					Makes no difference what your past has been;<br/>
					The living Christ will still come in.<br/>
					<br/>
					4. Just as you are in your body,<br/>
					Perfectly contained therein,<br/>
					God wants you for His container,<br/>
					All you need to do is let Him in.<br/>
					<br/>
					Would you open up from deep within?<br/>
					To let the Lord come in<br/>
					And fill you to the brim.<br/>
					Why not open up from deep within<br/>
					And call upon the name of Him.<br/>
					<br/>
					1. Bakit ka kaya nilikha?<br/>
					Ikaw ba ay namamangha?<br/>
					Ano ba ang iyong layunin?<br/>
					Bakit ka nabubuhay rin?<br/>
					<br/>
					Nais ng Diyos maging iyong buhay,<br/>
					Siya'y maging iyong buhay,<br/>
					Siya'y maging iyong buhay;<br/>
					Nilikha kang isang sisidlan,<br/>
					Nang Siya'y maging iyong laman.<br/>
					<br/>
					2. Taglay mo ang espiritu,<br/>
					Mas malalim sa puso mo;<br/>
					Punuin ka man ng mundo,<br/>
					Hungkag din ang espiritu.<br/>
					<br/>
					Matagal kang may kahungkagan,<br/>
					Lahat mong natikman,<br/>
					Di ka nasiyahan,<br/>
					Puso mo nawa'y buksang lubos,<br/>
					Papasukin si Hesus.<br/>
					<br/>
					3. Anuman ang iyong isipin,<br/>
					Sa Diyos lahat ay salarin,<br/>
					Daloy ng dugo ni Hesus,<br/>
					Kasalanan mo'y tinubos.<br/>
					<br/>
					Hesus ang lahat ay ginanap,<br/>
					Nang Siya'y iyong matanggap,<br/>
					Huwag kang magsumikap,<br/>
					Espiritu'y pupunuin ka<br/>
					Ng dibinong buhay Niya.<br/>
					<br/>
					4. Katawan mo ay sisidlan<br/>
					Ng iyong buong katauhan,<br/>
					Gayundin iyong espiritu,<br/>
					Nais ng Diyos masidlan 'to.<br/>
					<br/>
					Mula sa kaibuturan mo,<br/>
					Buksan ang iyong puso,<br/>
					Siya'y papasukin mo,<br/>
					Mula sa iyong kailaliman,<br/>
					Tawagin Kanyang ngalan.<br/>

					1. Do you know what you were saved for?<br/>
					Do you ever wonder why?<br/>
					What is God's intent and purpose?<br/>
					Why has Christ become your life?<br/>
					Up till now we Christians only knew<br/>
					Christ wants to get in you,<br/>
					And that, indeed, is true;<br/>
					Yet the vision goes much deeper still,<br/>
					He has a plan He must fulfill.<br/>
					<br/>
					2. Eden's river has a purpose,<br/>
					Bringing life where'er it goes;<br/>
					God's salvation, like a river,<br/>
					Goes through stages as it flows.<br/>
					First we're saved from Satan's tyranny,<br/>
					And later, we will see,<br/>
					From Christianity.<br/>
					God is flowing in recovery,<br/>
					Just open up to Him and see.<br/>
					<br/>
					3. Not just individual Christians,<br/>
					Isolated, wand'ring free,<br/>
					But as stones built up together,<br/>
					Christ expressing corporately.<br/>
					We were saved just Jesus to contain,<br/>
					But there's reason too,<br/>
					That Christ came into you;<br/>
					He came in, His purpose to secure,<br/>
					To gain for Him a Bride so pure.<br/>
					<br/>
					4. Not the stones, though very precious,<br/>
					Elevated "spiritually,"<br/>
					But the stones built up together<br/>
					In the Spirit, practically.<br/>
					You will ne'er be fully satisfied,<br/>
					Or be content inside,<br/>
					Till Jesus has His Bride.<br/>
					Did you know the Lord is seeking you<br/>
					To build into His building true?<br/>

					1. We have searched all o'er the mountain and the ridges,<br/>
					Hoping to know the truth of this life,<br/>
					Time and again, however, we met frustration,<br/>
					Knowing this is all the world could give.<br/>
					Then one day, Thou comest to meet us on the way,<br/>

					We were drawn to Thee, Lord, in Thy sweetness to stay,<br/>
					Now we know the real meaning of life.<br/>

					Thy own lovely self we're enjoying here today,<br/>

					Putong ng tinik dinanas Mo;<br/>
					Kamay Mong kaibig-ibig siyang alalay,<br/>

					1. One sat alone beside the highway begging,<br/>
					His eyes were blind, the light he could not see;<br/>
					He clutched his rags and shivered in the shadows,<br/>
					Then Jesus came and bade his darkness flee.<br/>
					<br/>
					When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;<br/>
					When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.<br/>
					He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,<br/>
					For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.<br/>
					<br/>
					2. From home and friends the evil spirits drove him,<br/>
					Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;<br/>
					He cut himself as demon pow'rs possessed him,<br/>
					Then Jesus came and set the captive free.<br/>
					<br/>
					When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;<br/>
					When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.<br/>
					He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,<br/>
					For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.<br/>
					<br/>
					3. "Unclean! Unclean!" the leper cried in torment,<br/>
					The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness stood near;<br/>
					The fever raged, disease had gripped its victim,<br/>
					Then Jesus came and cast out every fear.<br/>
					<br/>
					When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;<br/>
					When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.<br/>
					He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,<br/>
					For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.<br/>
					<br/>
					4. Their hearts were sad as in the tomb they laid him,<br/>
					For death had come and taken him away;<br/>
					Their night was dark and bitter tears were falling,<br/>
					Then Jesus came and night was turned to day.<br/>
					<br/>
					When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;<br/>
					When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.<br/>
					He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,<br/>
					For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.<br/>
					<br/>
					5. So men today have found the Savior able,<br/>
					They could not conquer passion, lust and sin;<br/>
					Their broken hearts had left them sad and lonely,<br/>
					Then Jesus came and dwelt, Himself, within.<br/>
					<br/>
					When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;<br/>
					When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.<br/>
					He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,<br/>
					For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.<br/>

					1. Now this was once my situation,<br/>

					In my fellows' estimation quite a guy!<br/>
					But all I met was great frustration,<br/>
					And the endless aggravation<br/>

					'Cept to slowly die and dream of someday!"<br/>

					With a joyful delegation,<br/>
					They were filled with great elation, Jesus too!<br/>
					And Jesus paid a visitation,<br/>
					By His new life germination,<br/>
					I became a new creation through and through.<br/>
					<br/>

					"Jesus, be my full salvation, be my life!"<br/>

					Now you've touched Him, so cry out, "Hallelujah!"<br/>
					As He fills you, cry aloud, "Oh my Lord!"<br/>

					Take my life, Lord, I belong to You!"<br/>
